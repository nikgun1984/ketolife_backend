<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![title](static/images/screen_shot.png)


Welcome to Keto Life website where you can easily find delicious recipes from breakfast to dessert, create new recipes and look up nutritional data of the ingredients. It has never been easier. In the past, i have done various diets and fastings and nothing was working for me until i found out about the Keto diet. I can tell you I saw the results after a couple of weeks. Some diets can be super painful, but not Keto. You can lead a healthy way of life on Keto and still get treats that you would never think are a part of your diet. So what is Keto diet? 

The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. (Wikipedia)

Keto diet is becoming more and more popular among people who want to lose weight and see the results of this diet in just as little as 1 week. This is the main reason i have decided to build this Keto recipe website.
